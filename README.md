About the Game

When the game starts, the player has full health, random money between 200 to 500 and 0 points. The player wins the game if they reach 10 points and loses if it falls below 0 points.

The player can buy the weapons, armours, keys and healing pads from the shop. The player can use the weapons to fight the enemies, armours to reduce the health of the enemies, healing pads to increase the player's health by 50 and keys to open the treasure box. Moreover, the player can sell these in the shop once they need money.

There are 4 cities in which the enemy exists. The player will have to fight with the enemy in each city. After the player enters the room, he/she can choose the weapon fight the enemy. Additionally, the player can choose whether he/she wants to use the armour. If the player thinks he cannot beat the enemy, he can run away from the city.

If the player wins, he/she gets the points, all the items and money in the city. If the player loses, 2 points are reduced. After the combat, the player loses the weapon and armour used in the combat regardless of the outcome.

There are treasure boxes hidden in some cities which can only be opened with the correct key to help the player win more quickly. The player can leave the game or reset the game at any time.

Enjoy the game! Good Luck!!
